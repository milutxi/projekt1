Hi Shiela!

Nice work! I know you've been working hard on the mobile menu, and you are nearly there however it still needs a bit more work.

As you can see by the grading below, you've ticked nearly all the boxes, so well done. There's a few things that could be fixed up, but most of it is great!

However, the missing < on the contact page, and the mobile menu should be fixed. Right now you are sitting right on the border of Gödkant and Välgodkant, but I would really need you to fix those things to get that VG grade with all boxes ticked.

So if you are sick of working on this you have a Gödkant already; but fixing those two things will give you a VG. It's your choice, but I have to be consistent with assessing everyone and I would really like you to finish those things to give you the VG grade.

PLease let me know if you are happy with how it is, or you want to fix it. If you do perhaps on Friday we can look at the mobile menu together and finish it off?
